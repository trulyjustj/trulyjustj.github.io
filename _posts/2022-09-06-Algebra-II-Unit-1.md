## Properties

| Property         | Addition         | Multiplication  |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Commutative      | a+b=b+a          | ab=ba           |
| Associate        | (a+6)+c=a+(6+c)  | (ab)c=a(bc)     |
| Identity         | a+0=a            | a1=a            |
| Inverse          | a+(-a)=0         | a * 1/2 = 1     |
| Distributive     | a+(b+c)=ab+ac    | (b+c)a=ba+ca    |
