## 1.2 Expressions

Variable: Letters used to represent unknown quantities.

Constant: A number on its own.

Coefficient: A number used to multiply a variable.

Term: The monomials that make up a polynomial.

Expression: A mathematical statement that contains at least one variable.

Equation: A mathematical sentence stating that two expressions are equal.

### Example 1

m+(n-1)^2 if m = 3 and n = -4

-> 3+(-4-1)^2

-> 3+(-5)^2

-> 3+25 = 28

## Properties

| Property         | Addition         | Multiplication  |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Commutative      | a+b=b+a          | ab=ba           |
| Associate        | (a+6)+c=a+(6+c)  | (ab)c=a(bc)     |
| Identity         | a+0=a            | a1=a            |
| Inverse          | a+(-a)=0         | a × 1/2 = 1     |
| Distributive     | a+(b+c)=ab+ac    | (b+c)a=ba+ca    |

### Example 1       Example 2 

2(5m+n)+3(2m-4n)

->10m+2n+6m-12n

->16m-10n

### Example 2 

3x(4x-2y)-2x(3x+y)

->12x^2-6xy-6x^2-2xy

->6x^2-8xy

## 1.3 Equations

### How To Solve an Equation

Simplify each side by removing parenthesis and combining like terms. Use addition/subtraction to isolate the variable term on one side. Use multiplication/division to solve for the variable.

### Example 1

6m-5=-3(2m+1)

->6m-5=-6m-3
+6m +5 +6m +5

->12m=2
   1/12
   
->m=1/6

### Example 2

 3/8n=6
 
 ×8/3  ×8/3
 
 ->n=48/3
 
 ->n=16
 
 
### Literal Equation

An equation where the variables represent known values.

### Example 1

Solve P=2L+2W for W

->P-2L=2W

->W=P-2L / 2

## 1.4 Solving Absolute Value Equations

### Absolute Value:

A numbers distance from zero on the number line by *x*  *x-c*=r   where *c* is the center, and *r* is the range.

### Examples

|8|=8   |-8|=8    |3.9|=3.9   |0|=0
