## AP Human Geography Unit 1

### Basics of Economic Development:

 * Formal economy: Any economy that is regulated or taxed by a government.
 * Informal economy: Any economy that is not taxed or regulated by a government.
 * GDP: Gross Domestic Product
   * A measurement showing the total value of all goods and services a country produces annually
 * GNP: Gross National Product
 * GNI: Gross National Income
 * GNI per capita: Gross National Income per capita (per person)
 * GII: Global Innovation Index
 * HDI: Human Development Index
   * A measurement of the quality of life in a country, on a scale of 0 to 1
 * PPP: Purchasing power parity

#### Additional Information:
A high GDP can improve HDI, but only if the country chooses to spend money on the people

 
### Anchor Countries:
 * United States
 * China
 * Rwanda
 * Nepal
 * Spain
 * Mexico
 * Nigeria
 * Russia
 * Japan

### Diffusion

Method by which Ideas Spread

### Types of Diffusion:
 * Relocation
 * Hierarchical
 * Contagious
 * Stimulus


### Relocation:

Happens when people immigrate or travel from one region to another, bringing new traditions and ideas with them.
The action of moving to a new place and establishing one's home or business there.


### Hierarchical:

Ideas traveling from a high status person or place to “normal” people and places.
Of the nature of a hierarchy; arranged in order of rank.


### Contagious:

Idea spreads rapidly and equally to all people across the population. (Ex: Memes)

### Stimulus:

When a group of people adapts or modifies an idea from another region.

### Space Time Compression:

World Communicating through devices.

### Distance Decay:

The further the distance from the heart(center/origin) the less the idea will diffuse.

### Formal Region:

Share specific characteristics that can be identified through data and plotted on a map. (Includes regions designated by a government)

### Functional Region:

Contains a node(important place or object) in the center.

### Vernacular Regions:

Based on people’s opinions.


> “You are the shuckiest shuck faced shuck in the world!” “I'm unpredictable, I never know where I'm going until I get there, I'm so random, I'm always growing, learning, changing, I'm never the same person twice. But one thing you can be sure of about me; is I will always do exactly what I want to do.”

### Indicators

* GDP, Gross Domestic Product: Total value of all final goods and services produced in a country, in a year.
* GNI PPP, Gross National Income (Purchasing Power Parity): The total income earned by everyone in a country.
* GNI PPP Per Capita, Gross National Income (Purchasing Power Parity) Per Capita: The average income for each person in a country (per capita = per person)
* Life Expectancy: How long the average person can expect to live.
* % Urban: The percentage of the population living in an urban area.
* IMR, Infant Mortality Rate: The number of children who die before age 1, per 1,000 children in a country.
* NIR, Natural Increase Rate: The difference between the number of live births and the number of deaths during the year. The natural increase is negative when the number of deaths exceeds the number of births.
* TFR, Total Fertility Rate: The average number of children born to a woman in her reproductive years.
* Human Development Index: a statistic that can be used to rank a country’s average life expectancy, education, gender/racial equality, and income levels.  Scored on a scale of 0-1, with higher values indicating higher human development.
* Gender Inequality Index (GII): a statistic that measures gender inequality in a country on a scale of 0-1 with 0 meaning both genders are completely equal.  It includes:
  * Reproductive health (access to birth control as well as  professional medical care for child birth and female-specific health problems)
  * Female literacy rate & educational attainment (what percentage of women can read and how many years of education an average woman completes)
  * Labor force participation (how many women engage in economic activity)
  * Female empowerment (legal protections such as voting rights, anti-discrimination laws, divorce rights, protection from domestic violence)
* Developed Country: a country with more advanced economy, industry, and human development index relative to other countries.
* Developing Country: a country with a less advanced economy, industry, and human development index relative to other countries.
* Indicators: measurements or statistics
* LDC: an abbreviation for less developed countries.
* MDC: an abbreviation for more developed countries.
* Imperialism: the attempt to control other countries through economic, military, or diplomatic means.
* Colonialism: gaining political control over a country, occupying it with military or civilian settlers, and exploiting it economically.
* Forced Migration: when a person migrates against their will.
* Formal economy: operates within an official legal framework that includes paying taxes on income and obeying governmental regulations.
* Formal job: any job in the formal economy.
* Informal economy: operates outside government regulation and does not pay taxes.
* Informal job: any job in the informal economy.
* Bulk Gaining Industry: An industry whose finished products are heavier or larger than the “ingredients” they are made from.
* Bulk Losing Industry: An industry whose finished products are lighter or smaller than the “ingredients” they are made from.
* Market: any place where goods are bought and sold.  
* Footloose Industry: an industry that does not need to be located near raw materials.  Many tech firms are footloose -- for example, Apple could manufacture cell phones almost anywhere, because the raw materials to assemble them are not heavy or difficult to move.
* Just in Time Delivery: a management system that delivers goods exactly when they are needed, so that businesses do not have to waste money stockpiling a large inventory.
* Agglomeration: when multiple businesses in the same industry are clustered together to access customers, resources, or supply chains.  Think about all the clothing stores grouped in a mall.  This happens in other, less glamorous industries too.  For example, auto manufacturers clustered in Detroit so they could all be near supplies of rubber and steel.
* Globalization: the increasing interaction and integration of people, businesses, and governments across the world.
* Outsourcing: shifting a job or service to an overseas location, typically in order to save money.
* Supply Chain: the network of people, businesses, and technologies required to move a resource to a manufacturer, and the finished product to a consumer.
* Intermodal shipping container: a standard-sized steel container that can be used on any form of transportation, including a cargo boat, a train, or semi truck.
* Containerization: the use of intermodal shipping containers to transport goods.
* Customs Laws: rules regarding the type and quantity of goods someone can bring into a country.
* Tariffs: taxes or fees a business must pay when importing goods into a country.
* Special Economic Zone (SEZ): an area where business and trade laws differ from the rest of the country.  These zones are typically located in developing countries and are intended to attract foreign businesses with incentives such as lower taxes and exemptions from tariffs.
* Export Processing Zone (EPZ): a specific type of special economic zone where exports can be sent out of the country with few or no tariffs.  These zones are intended to attract manufacturing, whereas special economic zones may attract a broader range of businesses, like banks or investment firms.
* Economic Interdependence: countries must trade with one another because no single country can manufacture all the goods it requires.
* Complementarity: when one country wants or needs to import the products that another country exports.
  * China and the US have high complementarity because China exports clothing and tech products, and Americans want to buy those things.
* Free Trade: international trade without tariffs (import taxes) or quotas (limits on imports)
  * European Union → Western Europe, about ½ of Eastern Europe
  * Mercosur → Most of South America, especially Brazil & Argentina
* Inputs: the raw materials, tools, and labor required to make a product.
* Outputs: goods and services created from raw materials, tools, and labor.
* Productivity: how much output you can create with a fixed quantity of inputs.
* Opportunity cost: the alternatives given up when one decides to pursue a particular course of action.
  * *In your life:* the opportunity cost of studying is giving up going to a party, or giving up a night binge watching Netflix.
  * *In real economies:* the opportunity cost of the industrializing is clean air and lots of forests; the opportunity cost of manufacturing cars is whatever else you could manufacture instead.
* Absolute advantage: a country’s ability to carry out an economic activity more efficiently than any other country.
  * For example, imagine the United States and China each have the same amount of metal.  If the US makes 200 planes and China makes 100 planes, the United States has the absolute advantage.
* Comparative Advantage: a country’s ability to carry out an economic activity at a lower opportunity cost than other countries
  * The United States could manufacture a lot of clothing in a little time (absolute advantage) but it would have to move people out of other, higher paying jobs to do so.
  * When China encourages people to take factory jobs, the opportunity cost is low because many of those people would have been poor farmers instead.  China has the comparative advantage.
* Interdependency: when two or more countries’ economies depend on one another.
* Sovereign Debt: the amount of money borrowed by a country’s government.
* Bonds: essentially, an IOU from a national government.  When a country takes on sovereign debt, it issues bonds to its lenders.  These bonds specify a guaranteed payment date and an interest rate.
* Default: when a country fails to pay back its loans.
* International Monetary Fund: an international organization that lends money to countries during financial crises, or to make improvements in development.
* Microloans: small, low-interest loans given to low-income people in developing countries to start small businesses.  Statistically, the majority of microloan recipients are women.
