## Intro to Biomolecules, 1.2 and 1.3
### Living systems require a constant input of energy
 * Law of conservation of energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed only transformed
 * Living systems follow the laws of energy
 * Living systems need a constant input of energy to grow, reproduce, and maintain organization
 * Living systems mainly use the energy stored in chemical bonds
 * As non-photosynthetic organisms, our energy comes from biomolecules (ie. carbohydrate)
 * You break the bonds in order to get energy
### Organic molecules
 * Organic molecules contain carbon and hydrogen atoms (better known as carbon-based)
### There are four classes that exist in living organisms…
 * Carbohydrates (sugars)
 * Lipids (fats)
 * Proteins (broken down into amino acids, link in a protein chain)
 * Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA)
### Biomolecules and Organic molecules are based on Carbon, let’s talk about carbon…
 * Carbon has 6 electrons and 6 protons
 * Not stable, 4 valence electrons missing
 * You will find carbon in other single covalent bonds and not by itself, like C2 or C-C (single line is single bond, double line is double bond, etc.)
### A polymer (many) is a large molecule made from repeating subunits called monomers (single)
 * You start with monomers → polymerization → polymer
 * One glucose is a monosaccharide
 * When you put two glucose molecules together, its a disaccharide
 * When you put many glucose molecules, you get starch, which is a polysaccharide
 * There is one nucleotide, then you combine them to get a nucleic acid
 * There is one amino acid, then you combine them to get a protein chain
 * Lipids are large molecules but not polymers (you need repeating units)
### Removing and adding water when using molecules
 * Monomers are assembled into polymers by a condensation reaction, also called a dehydration synthesis reaction. This occurs when two monomers bond together through the loss of a water molecule
 * You always have to remove water when you build molecules (dehydration synthesis)
 * Polymers are disassembled to monomers by hydrolysis, a reaction that is essentially the reverse of the dehydration reaction
 * You have to add water when you split molecules (condensation reaction)
 * Ex. glucose is a monomer, fructose is a monomer, if you want to combine them, dehydration synthesis.
 * You have to lose water when building molecules since carbon can only build 4 bonds at a time since it only has 4 valence electrons to share
 * You lose the bonds that make water (HO and O)
### Living systems require an exchange of matter
 * Carbon
 * Hydrogen
 * Oxygen
 * Nitrogen
 * Sulfur
 * Phosphorus
### Elements per macromolecules
 * Lipids and Carbs only contain Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen
 * Proteins contain Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and sometimes Sulfur
 * Nucleic Acids contain only Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Phosphorus

### What did we learn?
1. Living systems require a constant input of energy in order to grow, reproduce, and maintain organization.
2. Living systems must exchange matter with the environment in order to do the above processes. Since we are non-photosynthetic, we require the exchange of matter with the environment in order to get energy.
3. Dehydration synthesis reactions are reactions that involve the removal of water when building molecules as carbon can only have 4 bonds at a time.
4. In comparison to dehydration synthesis reactions, hydrolysis reactions involve adding water back to components when breaking up a molecule to complete the carbon bonds.
